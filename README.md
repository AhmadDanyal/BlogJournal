## Blog Journal
This project is a single page dynamic web app that allows you to create, edit and delete blog entries.

This is an evolved version of a simple .NET project I did a few years ago, except is was a back-end only Web API. This time I added a front-end and data saving capabilities using an XML save file.

Simple and Effective. Clone it to your local repository and build and run it. Enjoy!

- Front-End: HTML/CSS/Javascript
- Back-End: .NET
- Data Persistence: XML
